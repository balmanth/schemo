# Schemo Library

Welcome to my parser generator library, fell free to use it in any project that you want.

The purpose of this library is to provide a easy way to generate and maintain generic purpose parsers... And to make it possible, I will try to use this library in any personal project developed in the future, as I'm always learning something new I can evolve the library during the process.

## How to use

Download the last version of the [SPL](https://github.com/balmanth/spl) and put it in your `{PROJECT_INCLUDE}` directory.

```cpp
#include "{PROJECT_INCLUDE}/schemo/{SCHEMO_HEADER}"
```

> Replace `{PROJECT_INCLUDE}` and `{SCHEMO_HEADER}` to the corresponding path in your environment.

## Dependencies

This project uses the [SPL](https://github.com/balmanth/spl) take a time to check this amazing project.

## Disclaimer

This library is strictly personal, if you want to use some feature in production but found a bug, you are welcome to contact me and contribute.

Ah, and English isn't my main language, I'm trying to get better on that as well ðŸ˜Š
